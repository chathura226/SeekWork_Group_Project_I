1
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,555
Alex.

2
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:56,432
Tod and George's dad
just called.

3
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:58,159
He's picking you up
at 3.30 tomorrow.

4
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,653
The bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.00.

5
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:02,857
How's my suitcase
working out for you?

6
00:03:04,104 --> 00:03:06,790
Mom, you got
to leave that on.

7
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,050
The tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing...

8
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:14,271
so I figure it's got to be
on or with the bag.

9
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,681
For luck.

10
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,777
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

11
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:21,080
I'm still here.

12
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,273
So, seventeen, on the loose...

13
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,574
senior trip
with your friends in Paris...

14
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:33,164
ten days in the springtime.

15
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:38,151
Live it up. You got
your whole life ahead of you.

16
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:55,642
Hitchcock, let me give you
a hand with this.

17
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:57,561
There you go.

18
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:59,576
Carter, you dick.

19
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,397
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

20
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,946
- You left this on the bus.
- Thanks.

21
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,480
Come on,
let's get your stuff together.

22
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,358
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

23
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:12,139
- What are you doing?
- He's the man.

24
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:13,865
All right.
You guys got everything?

25
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,167
Yeah, Dad, we're all set.

26
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:21,729
Does that mean go?

27
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,127
Don't know.

28
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:27,292
This is for both of you.
Have a great time.

29
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:28,826
Thanks, Dad.

30
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:31,320
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

31
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,101
- Alex, take care of them.
- I will.

32
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,610
Didn't think anything could look
worse than my yearbook photo.

33
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:48,486
How do you think I feel
having to look at you?

34
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,885
What the fuck does he want?

35
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:05,750
The airport does not
endorse solicitors.

36
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,588
Death is not the end.

37
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,382
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

38
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,301
Hare Rama.

39
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:32,603
I have to ask you
a few questions this evening.

40
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:34,233
Did you pack your bags yourself?

41
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:37,879
Have your belongings been in
your possession the entire time?

42
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,194
Mr Browning?

43
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:49,003
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

44
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:03,101
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

45
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,978
September 25. 9.25.

46
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:09,335
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

47
00:07:22,282 --> 00:07:24,105
Fuck off, dude. Dick.

48
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,447
Babe.

49
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:29,092
George, Dad said both of us.
Give me some cash.

50
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,489
Knock it off.

51
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:35,612
You asshole.

52
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:47,890
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:18,290
Let's go take a shit.

54
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:20,977
- Take a shit by yourself.
- No, dude.

55
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:23,183
Listen, OK?
Take some knowledge.

56
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,006
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

57
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,361
The toilets in coach
are barely ventilated closets.

58
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,279
Say halfway
through the flight...

59
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,005
your body wants
that aeroplane food out.

60
00:08:32,485 --> 00:08:34,019
You got to go
torque a wicked cable.

61
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,623
Then directly after you,
walks in Christa or Blake.

62
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,939
Want them to associate you with
that watery sting in their eye?

63
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:45,816
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

64
00:08:50,995 --> 00:08:51,858
He was born

65
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:53,584
In the summer

66
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,557
Of his 27th year

67
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:57,901
Comin' home

68
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,626
John Denver.

69
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:05,093
He left yesterday behind him

70
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:07,395
Died in a plane crash.

71
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:09,792
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

72
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:11,710
At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding...

73
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:16,603
of Volee Air flight 180
to Paris through gate 46.

74
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,972
I've seen it raining fire

75
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:23,698
In the sky

76
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,508
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How did we lose him?

77
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,851
Go. Go.

78
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,609
Go.

79
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:08,583
That hurt.

80
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,804
That's a good sign.
Younger, the better.

81
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,681
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

82
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:36,491
A really fucked-up God.

83
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,861
- Hey, Tod.
- Hello. How you doing?

84
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:00,562
Can you switch seats
with Christa?

85
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:04,207
God, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

86
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:07,276
It's a urinary tract infection.

87
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,770
Let's go ask Alex.

88
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,511
Could you trade seats so Blake
and I could sit together?

89
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:24,156
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

90
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:27,129
Please?

91
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,131
You're so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.

92
00:11:34,706 --> 00:11:36,719
Thank you, Alex.

93
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,925
You're welcome.

94
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:46,982
You really think we'd
titty-fuck them over Greenland?

95
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:52,160
Because of you, I got to watch
fucking "Stuart Little".

96
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:54,654
Thank you.

97
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:56,956
Thanks, man. That's great.

98
00:11:58,682 --> 00:11:59,833
Sorry I'm late.

99
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,175
That's my seat right there.

100
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,614
Thanks.

101
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:05,396
- Hello?
- Ain't going that way.

102
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:07,218
May I have your attention?

103
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,368
To properly fasten
your seat belts...

104
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:10,670
slide the flat portion
into the buckle.

105
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:14,026
There are six emergency exits.

106
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:16,041
Two doors in front,
two over the wings...

107
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,150
two at the rear
of the aircraft.

108
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:24,768
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

109
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,844
All right.

110
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:17,326
Whatever.

111
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:36,888
It's fine.

112
00:13:44,178 --> 00:13:46,288
It's OK, honey.

113
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,656
Could you trade seats so
Blake and I could sit together?

114
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:09,726
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

115
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,219
Please?

116
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:19,699
What's up, dude?

117
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:25,455
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your fucking problem?

118
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:28,524
This fucking plane's
going to explode!

119
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:30,634
- Shut up, Browning.
- You're so not funny.

120
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,606
- If this is a joke...
- It's not a joke!

121
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:35,139
Alex, take it easy.

122
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,154
- Sit down!
- It's going down!

123
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,552
We'll remove you
if this continues.

124
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,279
I'll fucking remove myself!

125
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:46,170
- That's my seat.
- This plane is going down!

126
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,281
Everybody in the aisle
off the plane.

127
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,062
Just stay where you are.
Sit tight.

128
00:15:51,637 --> 00:15:53,746
This fucking plane
is going down!

129
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,472
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

130
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,529
- Get the fuck off me!
- Let go, jerk.

131
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,694
You got this?
No one gets back on board.

132
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,380
- That's my call.
- Wait, please!

133
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:19,065
I've got forty students
going to Paris. Please.

134
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,599
You must understand
my position.

135
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:22,711
I do, and I apologize
for Alex...

136
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,533
but one of us
needs to be on that plane.

137
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:27,792
I cannot let those students
go to Paris for ten days...

138
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:31,437
Sit the fuck down, Carter!
Sit!

139
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,355
One of you
can go on the flight.

140
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:35,561
Larry.

141
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:40,548
They're not taking this well.
One of us can get back on.

142
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:43,137
The rest can take
an 11.10 flight.

143
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:44,684
I'll stay.

144
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,686
You know the French thing.
Get on the plane.

145
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:48,413
It's fine.

146
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:52,441
Hi, I was in the bathroom,
and the lock was stuck...

147
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:55,318
Wait, I didn't fight
with anyone!

148
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:58,676
Damn!

149
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,209
Thanks.

150
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,786
I called your parents.
They're on their way.

151
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:13,829
Stupid Alex.

152
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,007
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

153
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,924
I saw it.

154
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,050
I don't know. I saw it.

155
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,720
I saw it on the runway,
I saw it take off...

156
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,310
I saw out my window,
I saw the ground.

157
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,283
And the cabin,
it starts to shake.

158
00:17:31,954 --> 00:17:34,735
The left side blows up
and the whole plane explodes.

159
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,091
And it was so real,
like how everything happens.

160
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:39,914
Been on a lot of planes
that blew up?

161
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,353
You fell asleep.

162
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:46,244
We get thrown off the plane
and blow a half day in Paris?

163
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,161
All because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

164
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:51,805
Wait! The plane,
it's going to blow up!

165
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,819
Fuck you, Horton.

166
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,409
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital!

167
00:17:56,985 --> 00:18:00,438
Get off him!
Alex, stop it!

168
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:06,096
There they go, here we stay.

169
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:09,549
You're paying for my trip.

170
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,083
I wish you were on that plane!

171
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,960
- You fucking prick!
- Shit!

172
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,318
- Call it in!
- Security!

173
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:16,107
You're looking at me
as if I caused this.

174
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,190
I didn't cause this.

175
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,177
Are there any survivors?

176
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:33,179
How should I know?

177
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:39,220
- You think I'm some...
- He's not a witch.

178
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,604
I'm Howard Seigel...

179
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,428
National Transportation
and Safety Board.

180
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:50,441
We've contacted
all your families.

181
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:51,687
They are on the way.

182
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:55,332
Is there anyone here
who feels they might need...

183
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:59,073
medical attention
or spiritual counselling?

184
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:02,526
What's going on?
Are there any survivors?

185
00:20:04,252 --> 00:20:06,841
The cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

186
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,239
The Nassau County
authorities are on the scene...

187
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:12,211
naval search and rescue
en route.

188
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,226
Excuse me. I'm Agent Weine.

189
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,294
This is Agent Schreck.
We're with the FBl.

190
00:20:17,774 --> 00:20:19,692
I understand how
you all must be feeling...

191
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,131
and I know it's going
to be difficult...

192
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,817
but we need to ask questions
regarding today's events...

193
00:20:24,296 --> 00:20:25,926
while they're still fresh
in your mind.

194
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:27,939
This will prove invaluable
to our rescue attempts...

195
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,913
and any potential
criminal investigation.

196
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:35,917
You said, "Listen to me".

197
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:38,106
"This plane will explode
on takeoff. "

198
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,792
How did you know that?

199
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:42,614
I got this feeling.

200
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,587
This weird feeling.

201
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:47,984
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding?

202
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:49,903
On board, did you take
any sleeping pills...

203
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:51,342
narcotics, hallucinogens?

204
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,835
Do you take any drugs?

205
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,191
I saw it.

206
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:01,027
I saw it happen.

207
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:02,658
I saw the plane explode.

208
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,481
Did the weird feelings
have anything to do...

209
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:08,125
with your saying you wished
Carter Horton was on it...

210
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,043
just before it exploded?

211
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,783
Then why'd you say it?

212
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:16,565
I didn't really think
it was going to happen.

213
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:18,099
If that's the case, Alex...

214
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:21,551
why did you really
get off the plane?

215
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:26,251
My brother George...

216
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,703
he told me to go
keep an eye on Alex.

217
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:34,306
And so he stayed and...

218
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:42,747
He told me
to get off the plane.

219
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:45,529
Larry Murnau said
I should get back on...

220
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:48,885
but I told him
that he should go.

221
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,816
I sent him back on the plane.

222
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:57,612
All right.

223
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:00,009
Nobody forced you off the plane.

224
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:02,982
You said you weren't friends
with those that were...

225
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,572
so, Clear, why did you
get off the plane?

226
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:10,079
Because I saw
and I heard Alex...

227
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,123
and I believed him.

228
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:38,852
There he is.

229
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:06,185
Thank you for the ride.

230
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:07,948
You are looking
at the first piece of debris...

231
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:10,921
to wash ashore
from Volee Air flight 180...

232
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:14,085
which erupted shortly after
a 9.25 PM takeoff...

233
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,579
from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.

234
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:18,689
There are no known survivors.

235
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:21,374
Coast Guard and naval
search and rescue efforts...

236
00:24:21,854 --> 00:24:23,101
are continuing
at this moment...

237
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:26,169
even as jet fuel burns
on the ocean's surface.

238
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:28,758
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

239
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:31,732
of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

240
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:35,569
All 287 passengers
are feared dead.

241
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,212
Amongst the travellers...

242
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:39,501
a class of forty students
and four teachers...

243
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:42,569
from Mount Abraham High School
in south-east New York...

244
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,679
en route to Paris
on a field trip.

245
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:46,789
There are reports
several students...

246
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:49,954
were removed from the aircraft
moments before departure...

247
00:24:50,434 --> 00:24:51,968
however, investigators
remain guarded...

248
00:24:52,544 --> 00:24:53,886
about the specifics
of this incident.

249
00:24:54,462 --> 00:24:57,436
Authorities from National
Transportation and Safety...

250
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:58,873
and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation...

251
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:02,039
have arrived at JFKto begin
the initial investigation.

252
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:05,587
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...

253
00:25:06,163 --> 00:25:08,464
report seeing the plane explode.

254
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:10,958
No other aircraft were
visibly near flight 180.

255
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,684
At JFK,
air traffic controllers...

256
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:15,561
are corroborating
these eyewitness accounts.

257
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:18,437
After the explosion,
debris apparently rained...

258
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,219
into the Atlantic Ocean
for several miles.

259
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:25,247
Investigators are cautious about
verifying these accounts...

260
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:27,550
believing they'll learn more...

261
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,128
Thirty-nine days
have passed...

262
00:25:49,703 --> 00:25:51,621
since we lost
our thirty-nine loved ones...

263
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:53,636
friends, and teachers.

264
00:25:54,882 --> 00:25:55,936
As each day passes...

265
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,910
without a determining cause
for the accident...

266
00:25:59,294 --> 00:26:01,307
we ask ourselves, "Why?"

267
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,856
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...

268
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:07,831
"Man no more knows
his own time...

269
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,802
"than fish taken
in the fatal net...

270
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:13,296
"or birds trapped in the snare.

271
00:26:13,871 --> 00:26:16,749
"Like these,
the children of men caught...

272
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:19,339
"when the time falls
suddenly upon them. "

273
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:22,600
And so,
before we can heal...

274
00:26:23,176 --> 00:26:26,818
before we escape the presence
of death and time...

275
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:29,888
we must mourn
and celebrate theirs...

276
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:32,285
with this memorial.

277
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,264
I hope you don't think because
my name ain't on this wall...

278
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:19,759
that I owe you anything.

279
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,197
I don't.

280
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:24,266
All I owe these people is
to live my life to the fullest.

281
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:27,431
Why don't you
stay off the J.D., then?

282
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:30,117
Don't you ever fucking
tell me what to do.

283
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:32,323
I control my life, not you.

284
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,980
I'm never going to die.

285
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,791
I took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

286
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,133
Got a seventy.

287
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:55,052
It's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

288
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:57,258
The thing is,
when I was done with the test...

289
00:27:57,737 --> 00:27:59,847
you know the guy that drives
with you during the test?

290
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,095
Anyways, he goes...

291
00:28:01,574 --> 00:28:05,121
"Young man, you're going to die
at a very young age. "

292
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:09,737
Is that true?

293
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,698
Not now, not here,
not ever, Billy.

294
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:18,549
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

295
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:20,274
Fuck.

296
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,414
Don't talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.

297
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:36,580
I'm going up.

298
00:28:49,143 --> 00:28:50,580
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

299
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,322
I miss you, you know?

300
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,679
Yeah, I miss you, too.

301
00:28:58,254 --> 00:29:01,034
But my father,
he doesn't understand.

302
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:05,638
Look, when he gets over
this thing...

303
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,803
you and me,
we'll road trip to the city...

304
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:10,913
catch the Yanks.

305
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,983
We'll do that.

306
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,517
Cool.

307
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:19,352
I better go.

308
00:29:19,832 --> 00:29:21,270
This thing Ms Lewton
showed me in class...

309
00:29:21,654 --> 00:29:23,573
they're going to let me read it.

310
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,970
It says what I'm feeling.

311
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:29,327
Take care, man.

312
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:40,835
Because of you,
I'm still alive.

313
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:44,768
Thank you.

314
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:55,318
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast.

315
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:59,633
But when we say this...

316
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,647
we imagine
that the hour is placed...

317
00:30:02,222 --> 00:30:05,101
in an obscure
and distant future.

318
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:08,072
It never occurs to us
that it has any connection...

319
00:30:08,648 --> 00:30:10,949
with the day already begun...

320
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:14,978
or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

321
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,526
This afternoon
which is so certain...

322
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:24,186
and which has every hour
filled in advance.

323
00:35:54,579 --> 00:35:55,730
What happened?

324
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:57,936
Where's Tod?

325
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:05,321
Get out of here.

326
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,338
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

327
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:25,844
You caused Tod
so much guilt over George...

328
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,050
he took his own life.

329
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:33,901
He wouldn't do that.

330
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,546
He said we'd be friends again
after you got better.

331
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:40,903
Why would he make plans
if he was going to kill himself?

332
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:43,394
Mr Waggner.

333
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,992
Almost Autumn.

334
00:37:40,267 --> 00:37:42,857
It's only the end of June.

335
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,597
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

336
00:37:47,173 --> 00:37:48,899
If you focus, even now,
just one week into summer...

337
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,297
you can almost feel
autumn coming.

338
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:53,502
I like being able
to see the future.

339
00:37:54,078 --> 00:37:57,338
Why were you at
Tod's house last night?

340
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:01,847
I've seen enough TV to know...

341
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:04,148
the FBl doesn't investigate
teen suicides.

342
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:06,546
They were there last night.
That means, one...

343
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:08,175
they still don't have a clue
what caused the crash.

344
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:09,709
Two... they haven't
ruled out anything...

345
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:11,629
and the fact seven people
got off the plane...

346
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:13,068
is probably weird enough.

347
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:15,273
Not to mention, one of
those people had a vision...

348
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,479
of the plane exploding...

349
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:20,644
minutes before it actually did
is highly suspicious.

350
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:22,658
And it doesn't help that
the visionary's friend...

351
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:24,479
just committed suicide.

352
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:28,029
Why were you there last night?

353
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,509
You know what this is?

354
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:39,633
This is a...

355
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:44,428
This is Springy Head Guy.

356
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:49,799
It's you. Not a likeness.

357
00:38:50,374 --> 00:38:53,157
It's how
you make me feel, Alex.

358
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,321
I'm sorry.

359
00:38:56,896 --> 00:38:58,527
No. Like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know...

360
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,827
what or why it is.

361
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:03,130
It's reluctant to take form...

362
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:05,335
and yet creating an absolute...

363
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:08,405
but incomprehensible
attraction.

364
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:11,666
In four years
of high school...

365
00:39:12,241 --> 00:39:13,776
we haven't said
one word to each other.

366
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,844
At that moment, on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

367
00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:19,529
I didn't even know where
those emotions came from...

368
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:21,927
until you started
freaking out.

369
00:39:22,502 --> 00:39:26,339
I didn't see what you saw,
but I felt it.

370
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:29,025
You can still feel it,
can't you?

371
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:32,668
Something from that day
is still with you.

372
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,271
I know because
I can still feel you.

373
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:41,972
That's why I was there
last night.

374
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:46,863
I've never dealt
with death before.

375
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,645
This could all be in our head.

376
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:53,288
It just feels like
it's all around us.

377
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:55,111
It?

378
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,098
What if Tod was just the first?

379
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,304
Of us.

380
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:04,798
Is that something
that you're feeling?

381
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,386
I don't know.

382
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:10,934
I wish I could see him
one last time.

383
00:40:11,414 --> 00:40:13,332
Maybe I would know.

384
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:15,538
Then let's go see him.

385
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,036
Easy.

386
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,544
Gives me a rush.

387
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,476
This place?

388
00:40:54,956 --> 00:40:56,971
Doing something
I'm not supposed to.

389
00:41:00,326 --> 00:41:01,382
Come on.

390
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:07,903
Hurry up.

391
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,823
- Is that him?
- I think.

392
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,316
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

393
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:28,906
That's him.

394
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:33,030
Whatever it was that made him
Tod is definitely gone.

395
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:37,059
Holy Christ!

396
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:41,085
Please.

397
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:44,059
You'll wake the dead.

398
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:55,568
Why'd his hand do that?

399
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:56,910
Chemicals.

400
00:41:57,486 --> 00:42:00,842
The vascular flush
creates cadaveric spasms.

401
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:04,679
Look, I'm his friend...

402
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,597
I know who you are.

403
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:09,570
What are all those tiny marks?

404
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:13,119
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

405
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,325
Pulling at the wire?

406
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,010
If he was pulling at the wire,
he didn't kill himself.

407
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,352
It was an accident.

408
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:22,326
In death,
there are no accidents...

409
00:42:22,805 --> 00:42:25,299
no coincidences, no mishaps...

410
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,504
and no escapes.

411
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:32,395
What you have to realize
is we're all just a mouse...

412
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,314
a cat has by the tail.

413
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:37,096
Every single move we make...

414
00:42:37,574 --> 00:42:39,109
from the mundane
to the monumental...

415
00:42:39,686 --> 00:42:42,082
the red light
that we stop at or run...

416
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,056
the people we have sex with
or won't with us...

417
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:48,123
aeroplanes that we ride
or walk out of...

418
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:51,289
it's all part of
death's sadistic design...

419
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,303
leading to the grave.

420
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,468
Design.

421
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:59,057
Does that mean if...

422
00:42:59,537 --> 00:43:01,263
you figure out the design,
you can cheat death?

423
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,908
Alex, you've
already done that...

424
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:06,922
by walking off the plane.

425
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:09,127
Your friend's departure...

426
00:43:09,607 --> 00:43:13,443
shows that death has
a new design for all of you.

427
00:43:14,018 --> 00:43:15,937
Now you have to figure out...

428
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:19,869
how and when
it's coming back at you.

429
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:22,170
Play your hunch...

430
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:25,145
if you think
you can get away with it.

431
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:27,349
But remember...

432
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:30,324
the risk of cheating the plan...

433
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,624
of disrespecting the design...

434
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,803
could incite a fury to terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

435
00:43:39,433 --> 00:43:43,270
And you don't even want to
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

436
00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:49,025
OK, then. Well...

437
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:52,093
I'm sorry we broke in,
and...

438
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:55,353
No harm, no foul.

439
00:43:59,477 --> 00:44:00,725
I'll see you soon.

440
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:09,643
The mortician said
that death has a design.

441
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:13,576
I'm talking about omens.

442
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,069
How do we know,
that just by sitting here...

443
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,755
by sipping this coffee
or breathing the air...

444
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:20,673
or even crossing
the intersection...

445
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:22,879
we haven't started in motion...

446
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,892
the events that will
some day lead to our death...

447
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:27,674
forty years from now,
ten years, tomorrow?

448
00:44:29,304 --> 00:44:31,895
We don't,
unless we open ourselves up...

449
00:44:32,373 --> 00:44:34,962
to the signs
it's willing to show us.

450
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:39,758
I don't understand.

451
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:42,635
Did you see Tod die?

452
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,513
Did it happen again,
like on the plane?

453
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:48,678
No, it didn't,
but it might as well have.

454
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:52,322
This is a message
from something, Clear...

455
00:44:52,897 --> 00:44:55,391
or someone,
hinting at a design.

456
00:44:55,871 --> 00:44:57,117
Total bullshit.

457
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:59,514
You can find death omens
anywhere you want to.

458
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:02,584
Coffee starts with a "C"
and ends with an "E".

459
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,557
So does "choke".
We'll choke to death?

460
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,667
I want to hear you...

461
00:45:08,243 --> 00:45:10,161
but we'll go nuts
if you start with this shit.

462
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:14,381
The mortician said
that death has a design, right?

463
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:18,024
Now, what if
you, me, Tod, Carter...

464
00:45:18,696 --> 00:45:21,285
Terry, Billy, Mrs Lewton
messed up that design?

465
00:45:21,765 --> 00:45:23,780
For whatever reason,
I saw death's plan...

466
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:26,080
and we cheated it.

467
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,998
But what if it was our time?

468
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:29,917
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

469
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:33,081
What if it still is our time?

470
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:36,534
If it is,
then it's not finished...

471
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,467
and we will die.
Now, not later.

472
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:46,413
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

473
00:45:55,715 --> 00:45:58,112
After hearing you,
I do believe...

474
00:45:59,168 --> 00:46:01,279
that Tod killed himself.

475
00:46:33,214 --> 00:46:34,557
Baby, come on, not now.

476
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:38,969
Looks like we have
a reunion here.

477
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:40,216
Let it go.

478
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,325
- When are you moving?
- Couple weeks.

479
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:44,435
- That's too bad.
- Carter, you dick!

480
00:46:44,914 --> 00:46:46,449
Losing our favourite teacher.

481
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:49,422
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

482
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:52,971
Lived here your whole life,
and now she's gotta move...

483
00:46:53,642 --> 00:46:54,506
We're in danger!

484
00:46:54,985 --> 00:46:57,191
Enough! Both of you!

485
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:59,204
They died, and we lived.

486
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:00,931
Get over it.

487
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:02,945
I will not let
this plane crash...

488
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,342
be the most important thing
in my life!

489
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:06,878
God!

490
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:09,371
I'm moving on, Carter...

491
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:11,481
and if you want
to waste your life...

492
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:15,029
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

493
00:47:15,508 --> 00:47:17,522
then you can just
drop fucking dead!

494
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:45,911
Is Alex there?

495
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:48,501
Hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.

496
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:52,145
It's Clear again.
You want to talk to her?

497
00:47:56,364 --> 00:47:58,570
Clear, he's in the shower.

498
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:00,105
Can I get him to call you back?

499
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:02,023
Sure. Bye.

500
00:48:02,982 --> 00:48:05,188
She's concerned about you.

501
00:48:05,668 --> 00:48:07,009
I'm concerned about you.

502
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:08,736
Why won't you talk to her?

503
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:11,133
Or to me?

504
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:16,312
Dad, you and Mom have
both been a big help...

505
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:18,040
but there's something
I need to understand...

506
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:19,766
before I can talk.

507
00:48:20,149 --> 00:48:21,300
To anyone.

508
00:48:23,985 --> 00:48:25,327
The National
Transportation Safety Board...

509
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:28,301
has a new theory tonight
on the cause of the explosion...

510
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,315
of Volee Air flight 180.

511
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,001
Officials believe deterioration
of silicone insulation...

512
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,494
on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...

513
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,084
may have leaked
combustible fluids.

514
00:48:38,659 --> 00:48:39,426
That's Tod's seat.

515
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:41,344
A spark beneath the coach cabin
in the fuselage...

516
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:43,837
may have ignited the fuel line,
proceeding to the fuel pump...

517
00:48:44,317 --> 00:48:46,715
which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.

518
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:18,363
The path of the explosion.

519
00:49:18,938 --> 00:49:22,967
First was Tod,
then it was Terry.

520
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,557
They're dying in the order
they would've died.

521
00:49:26,037 --> 00:49:27,667
That's death's design.

522
00:49:28,242 --> 00:49:30,353
Ms Lewton's next.

523
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:35,914
Whenever I can fall asleep,
I see Terry Chaney...

524
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:38,791
and in the day,
out of nowhere...

525
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:40,710
I hear the sound of
my own voice in my head...

526
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,724
saying to Larry Murnau...

527
00:49:43,299 --> 00:49:44,641
"No. You know
the whole French thing.

528
00:49:45,218 --> 00:49:46,081
"Get on the plane. "

529
00:49:46,656 --> 00:49:48,958
Everything reminds me
of that day.

530
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:53,177
Right. Yeah.

531
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:54,520
I'm hoping a change will help.

532
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:56,822
It's just that...

533
00:49:57,302 --> 00:50:00,082
I lived here
my whole life, you know?

534
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:02,289
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

535
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:08,139
And now all I see
is Larry and those kids.

536
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:11,688
Just looking out
my own front yard...

537
00:50:12,263 --> 00:50:14,085
makes me feel nothing but fear.

538
00:50:20,414 --> 00:50:22,621
Laura, I'm going to have
to call you back.

539
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:24,346
Right.

540
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,376
This is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.

541
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:01,653
What are you doing here?

542
00:51:02,038 --> 00:51:04,435
I was just...

543
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,408
checking the air in the tyre
to make sure it's safe.

544
00:51:08,752 --> 00:51:09,902
Get in the car.

545
00:51:21,218 --> 00:51:23,137
Put on your seat belt.

546
00:51:44,907 --> 00:51:47,018
I believe that...

547
00:51:48,456 --> 00:51:50,277
that Ms Lewton is next.

548
00:51:51,237 --> 00:51:52,388
Next?

549
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,745
Yeah, next, because...

550
00:51:56,128 --> 00:51:58,623
there's this pattern
that's occurring.

551
00:51:59,102 --> 00:52:00,444
Right. A pattern.

552
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:02,362
You noticed that, too?

553
00:52:18,378 --> 00:52:19,530
Mom's favourite.

554
00:52:41,587 --> 00:52:43,026
So what about this pattern?

555
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:45,136
Did you see it
in one of your visions?

556
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:47,821
Did you catch it
in some TV static?

557
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:53,096
I never asked for
what happened on the plane.

558
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,166
You guys are going to
sit there and make fun of me.

559
00:52:56,646 --> 00:52:57,516
Whatever. It's fine.

560
00:52:57,699 --> 00:53:00,577
But I saved six lives
on that plane.

561
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:02,974
Six lives, and everybody
in my entire school...

562
00:53:03,453 --> 00:53:04,221
thinks I'm a freak.

563
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,154
I'm not suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

564
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:11,414
I don't have
a narcissistic deity complex.

565
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:14,674
I'm not going Dahmer
on you guys.

566
00:53:15,249 --> 00:53:16,881
This just is.

567
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,566
There is a pattern for us all.

568
00:53:20,141 --> 00:53:21,868
There is a pattern for you.

569
00:53:22,348 --> 00:53:24,457
There is a design for everyone,
and I don't know how yet...

570
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:26,472
but I'm going to break
this one.

571
00:54:44,634 --> 00:54:46,073
You came to our attention...

572
00:54:46,456 --> 00:54:48,567
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

573
00:54:49,142 --> 00:54:50,869
Now...

574
00:54:51,347 --> 00:54:52,691
I know you didn't
blow up the plane.

575
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,472
We were ready to move on...

576
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:57,677
but then the other survivors
started to die.

577
00:54:58,156 --> 00:54:59,499
First, your friend Tod...

578
00:54:59,979 --> 00:55:02,088
then Terry Chaney,
while you were at the scene.

579
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:04,391
And tonight, we pick you up
at Val Lewton's house.

580
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:07,076
Nobody has control
over life and death...

581
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:10,625
unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

582
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:13,310
Can you promise me
no one else is going to die?

583
00:55:13,886 --> 00:55:15,612
No, I can't.

584
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,626
As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control.

585
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:19,161
I'm sorry.

586
00:55:26,737 --> 00:55:28,846
Go ahead.
Get out of here.

587
00:55:29,998 --> 00:55:31,053
Thank you.

588
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:41,027
That kid gives me the creeps.

589
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:43,137
What do we do?
We got nothing.

590
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:45,056
That's not
what I'm talking about.

591
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:47,548
There were
a couple of moments...

592
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:51,097
where I almost believed him.

593
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:54,453
Don't take this
the wrong way...

594
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:57,139
but sometimes
you give me the creeps.

595
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:16,033
You've got to stop this.
It's a stupid mug.

596
00:56:16,512 --> 00:56:17,662
You're out of here.

597
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:19,293
Pretty soon you'll be gone.

598
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:20,829
You'll be gone.

599
00:58:41,904 --> 00:58:44,782
All right,
just stay still, OK?

600
00:58:53,126 --> 00:58:54,468
Oh, God, Ms Lewton.

601
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:31,967
Dude.

602
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:35,899
I don't know where he is.

603
00:59:36,954 --> 00:59:37,826
He's not talking to me.

604
00:59:37,913 --> 00:59:38,872
Why?

605
00:59:39,448 --> 00:59:41,078
Because I didn't believe him.

606
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,284
If he does contact you,
I think it would be...

607
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:45,874
in the best interest of
your safety if you called us.

608
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,654
Now, here's my card.

609
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:50,572
Toll-free number.

610
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:56,136
Interesting work.

611
01:00:07,165 --> 01:00:08,316
Carter, you dick!

612
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:26,345
What are you doing?

613
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:30,757
Terry should be on this wall.

614
01:00:33,252 --> 01:00:34,689
Shit.

615
01:00:36,128 --> 01:00:37,280
Why'd you want us
to meet you here?

616
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,402
They're watching me
to see if I go to Alex.

617
01:00:42,073 --> 01:00:43,609
That's why you're taking me.

618
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:45,239
Why would I want to see him?

619
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:48,883
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

620
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:04,803
Drive the speed limit, OK?

621
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,681
And don't pass on the right.

622
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:10,462
Billy, wait a minute.
I'm getting a vision.

623
01:01:12,476 --> 01:01:13,532
You're the next one, man.

624
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:15,257
Man, why'd you say that?

625
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:18,230
Because if you say another word,
I'll fucking kill you.

626
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:40,385
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down the road...

627
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:43,262
so you guys start that way
and meet back in the middle.

628
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,564
It'll take half the time.

629
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,542
Do you think
they're still up there?

630
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:21,913
Somehow, flight 180,
are they still in flight?

631
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:25,461
Somewhere... are they safe?

632
01:02:28,913 --> 01:02:32,078
When I was a kid,
like six or seven...

633
01:02:32,557 --> 01:02:34,667
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

634
01:02:35,146 --> 01:02:37,449
Lying awake at night,
just worrying.

635
01:02:37,928 --> 01:02:39,846
Most kids do, I guess.

636
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:42,914
Most kids never have it happen.

637
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:48,478
When I was ten...

638
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:50,972
my dad went into a 7-Eleven
for cigarettes.

639
01:02:51,452 --> 01:02:53,466
He heard someone say,
"Don't turn around".

640
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:57,205
On reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

641
01:02:58,644 --> 01:03:00,081
A guy blew his head off.

642
01:03:01,713 --> 01:03:03,343
Life became shit after that.

643
01:03:04,398 --> 01:03:06,317
My mom couldn't deal anymore.

644
01:03:07,755 --> 01:03:10,153
She married this asshole
who my mom with my real dad...

645
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:12,743
would have crossed the street
to avoid this guy.

646
01:03:14,084 --> 01:03:15,043
He didn't really want a kid...

647
01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:17,633
so my mom didn't, either,
anymore.

648
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:23,100
If that was the design
for my father and family...

649
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:25,497
then fuck death!

650
01:03:26,648 --> 01:03:30,485
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere.

651
01:03:30,964 --> 01:03:32,307
It exists, that place...

652
01:03:32,786 --> 01:03:34,129
where my dad is safe.

653
01:03:34,608 --> 01:03:37,773
Where he had a full pack of
cigarettes and kept driving.

654
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,842
Where me and my mom and my dad
are still together...

655
01:03:41,514 --> 01:03:43,816
and have no idea
about this life here.

656
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:49,377
Where our friends
are still in the sky.

657
01:03:49,857 --> 01:03:52,926
Where everyone
gets a second chance.

658
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:56,475
Alex, we can't give up.

659
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:03,573
I can't go home,
because after Mrs Lewton...

660
01:04:04,148 --> 01:04:05,011
they're looking for me.

661
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:07,119
We're taking you
to my dad's cabin.

662
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:08,751
It's a couple of miles
from my house.

663
01:04:09,231 --> 01:04:11,915
Browning,
you fucking warlock...

664
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,450
did you hear about
Ms Lewton or what?

665
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:15,656
Why do you think I was hiding?

666
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:19,301
Billy told the FBl he saw you
running from her house.

667
01:04:19,876 --> 01:04:20,931
I was running 'cause
they blame me for everything.

668
01:04:21,411 --> 01:04:22,656
They blame me
for Tod, for her...

669
01:04:23,232 --> 01:04:24,095
for the fucking plane crash.

670
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,781
The fire caramelized her blood.

671
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,946
Your shoe prints were in it,
your fingerprints on the knives.

672
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:31,288
I told you they were not...

673
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:33,206
I'm not talking about
if you did it.

674
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:35,988
Or even if
you knew she was dead.

675
01:04:36,564 --> 01:04:39,154
Did you know she was going
to be next before she was?

676
01:04:45,866 --> 01:04:47,113
Yeah, I did.

677
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:49,511
I knew.

678
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:53,059
All right, out of us...

679
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,786
who's next to see it?

680
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,512
Please...

681
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,716
tell me I'm going to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

682
01:04:59,197 --> 01:05:02,266
It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.

683
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,349
I should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

684
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:08,979
What are you whining about?
I'm next!

685
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,953
He didn't say anything.
Just drive.

686
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:14,734
You have a responsibility
to tell me.

687
01:05:15,309 --> 01:05:17,706
Think it's easier to know?

688
01:05:19,817 --> 01:05:21,543
It's not.
It's fucking harder.

689
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:24,707
You get off
having control over me?

690
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:26,242
Let me decide
how to deal with it.

691
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:28,928
It doesn't matter who's next...

692
01:05:29,503 --> 01:05:31,709
'cause we're
all on the same list.

693
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:35,162
Fuck.

694
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:36,696
Really?

695
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:44,464
Then why bother?

696
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:45,904
What's the fucking point?

697
01:05:46,383 --> 01:05:47,918
Me and Terry'll be back
together on the other side...

698
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,451
so why wait any longer?

699
01:05:51,177 --> 01:05:52,904
What are you doing?

700
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,357
Carter, slow down.

701
01:05:56,837 --> 01:05:58,754
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you!

702
01:06:01,152 --> 01:06:01,919
Knock it off!

703
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:03,838
May as well go out
on my own free will!

704
01:06:04,317 --> 01:06:05,754
Not with us
in the fucking car!

705
01:06:12,661 --> 01:06:14,099
Jesus, Carter!

706
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:16,613
Carter, stop the car!

707
01:06:16,689 --> 01:06:18,319
What's the fucking worry
if it ain't your time?

708
01:06:18,703 --> 01:06:20,141
I can get nailed
running this next red light.

709
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:21,484
You all wouldn't get shit.

710
01:06:21,868 --> 01:06:23,114
It doesn't work that way!

711
01:06:32,225 --> 01:06:34,431
I fucking hated French class!

712
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:37,405
- Get control of yourself.
- That's what I'm doing!

713
01:06:37,884 --> 01:06:40,089
I know what you're doing,
and it's all right to be scared.

714
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:42,487
I'm not afraid.
I decide when it's time.

715
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,460
I control my life.
I control my death.

716
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,858
You don't have to prove
how big your balls are!

717
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:53,421
Stop driving
like such an asshole.

718
01:06:53,996 --> 01:06:55,148
What are you doing?

719
01:06:56,872 --> 01:06:58,024
Jesus Christ!

720
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:00,134
Put your hands
back on the wheel!

721
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:02,147
- Carter, stop!
- Back on the wheel!

722
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,697
Shit.

723
01:07:08,287 --> 01:07:09,341
Carter, easy.

724
01:07:09,916 --> 01:07:12,313
I am so close to puking
right now.

725
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:17,013
We're afraid, too,
but we're not quitting.

726
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,506
Stop it and stop
this fucking car!

727
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,535
Damn it, I want you
to stop this car right now!

728
01:07:42,907 --> 01:07:43,867
- Move it.
- Open the door, Billy.

729
01:07:44,442 --> 01:07:45,689
Move the fucking car!

730
01:07:46,073 --> 01:07:48,854
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

731
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:53,073
- Can't you open the door?
- Open the fucking door.

732
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,527
- Open it!
- Billy, open the door!

733
01:08:01,226 --> 01:08:04,104
Carter, listen to me.
Don't do this.

734
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:11,296
God damn it!
Get out of the fucking car!

735
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:14,172
Carter, listen to me!

736
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:15,612
This isn't the way!

737
01:08:15,995 --> 01:08:17,626
It's not the way!
Get out of the car!

738
01:08:18,009 --> 01:08:19,351
It's coming!

739
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,586
It ain't my time.

740
01:08:36,327 --> 01:08:37,094
Shit.

741
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:39,013
Listen to me!
This isn't the way.

742
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:40,642
Get out of the car!

743
01:08:43,519 --> 01:08:46,014
Come on! Get out!

744
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:54,453
I can't get out!

745
01:09:05,867 --> 01:09:07,305
Man, he really is next.

746
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:11,142
Get out!

747
01:09:11,621 --> 01:09:12,771
Fuck!

748
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,815
Oh, God!

749
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,171
I saw it! I saw the belt!

750
01:09:36,652 --> 01:09:37,723
You scared now?

751
01:09:37,898 --> 01:09:38,858
It broke!

752
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:40,392
Bullshit!

753
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:41,639
He saved your life again.

754
01:09:42,023 --> 01:09:43,077
That's right!

755
01:09:43,557 --> 01:09:44,612
You're next, Carter!

756
01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:46,818
I'm staying the fuck
away from you!

757
01:09:47,394 --> 01:09:49,311
- Shut up, Billy!
- We don't need this shit now.

758
01:09:49,791 --> 01:09:51,133
I don't need it ever!

759
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:52,572
Get away from him! He's next!

760
01:09:53,051 --> 01:09:54,203
Fuck you, Billy!
I'm not dead!

761
01:09:54,682 --> 01:09:56,024
You will be.

762
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,230
You're dead...

763
01:09:59,574 --> 01:10:00,724
and you ain't taking me
with you!

764
01:10:04,944 --> 01:10:07,053
- God, no!
- Oh, shit!

765
01:10:15,972 --> 01:10:17,603
Jesus fucking Christ!

766
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:20,098
You should have been next.

767
01:10:20,673 --> 01:10:22,686
You were after Lewton.
That's the plan!

768
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:24,988
That's the design!
You should be fucking dead!

769
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:26,538
You're the devil!

770
01:10:26,714 --> 01:10:28,728
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip!

771
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,647
That's how I saved him.

772
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:32,372
Just like the explosion.
I saw it!

773
01:10:32,852 --> 01:10:34,579
- The police are coming.
- Fuck! I saved him!

774
01:10:35,154 --> 01:10:36,496
Because I saved him,
it skipped Carter...

775
01:10:36,976 --> 01:10:39,182
and went to the next person
in the path of the explosion!

776
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:41,004
I have to see it.

777
01:10:41,579 --> 01:10:42,443
Then I intervene...

778
01:10:43,018 --> 01:10:44,841
and if I intervene,
I cheat the design.

779
01:10:45,416 --> 01:10:47,238
Intervene? Are you God now?

780
01:10:47,813 --> 01:10:49,540
God's not afraid to die.

781
01:10:50,115 --> 01:10:51,746
Gods don't die! We do!

782
01:10:52,226 --> 01:10:54,911
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.

783
01:10:55,391 --> 01:10:56,732
We have to get you
back to my cabin.

784
01:10:57,212 --> 01:10:58,650
You can hide out
and get your head together.

785
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:00,761
After Billy, I'm next.

786
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,295
I'm next.

787
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:04,598
Then me.

788
01:11:04,981 --> 01:11:07,570
Listen, I'm not going
to let it happen.

789
01:11:08,146 --> 01:11:09,008
Listen to me.

790
01:11:09,489 --> 01:11:12,366
Why don't you two
get the fuck out of here?

791
01:14:00,296 --> 01:14:02,023
Rusted.

792
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:03,653
Tetanus.

793
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:06,434
Nice one.

794
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,311
I overlooked it.

795
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,107
You tried to capitalize,
but I caught you.

796
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:15,737
You fuck!

797
01:14:17,176 --> 01:14:18,326
I can beat you.

798
01:14:19,861 --> 01:14:21,108
Maybe not forever...

799
01:14:21,588 --> 01:14:24,176
but I got this cabin
rigged to beat you now!

800
01:15:14,622 --> 01:15:15,869
She was there a minute ago.

801
01:15:16,924 --> 01:15:17,788
What are you talking about?

802
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:20,089
I'm not turning him in.

803
01:15:21,145 --> 01:15:22,870
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

804
01:15:25,556 --> 01:15:26,804
I go with you.

805
01:15:27,762 --> 01:15:28,913
You can't.

806
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:33,132
Just tell us where he is.

807
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:34,954
Wait at home.
I give you my word...

808
01:15:35,433 --> 01:15:37,928
we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

809
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:08,713
I never moved.

810
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:12,454
Christa asked me to change,
but I never moved.

811
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:14,947
I would have been up
next to Tod.

812
01:16:16,482 --> 01:16:18,017
Fuck!
Why didn't I remember that?

813
01:16:18,592 --> 01:16:20,606
I never moved. Clear's seat
was in front of mine.

814
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,158
She's next.

815
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,944
Get in the car!
We're going around!

816
01:18:28,448 --> 01:18:30,557
- There!
- Come on, let's go!

817
01:18:36,696 --> 01:18:38,423
Alex, we're trying to help you.

818
01:18:41,204 --> 01:18:43,026
Prince! Get away from it!

819
01:18:55,013 --> 01:18:56,356
Hold on!

820
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:27,334
Run!

821
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:12,505
We lost him.

822
01:20:12,984 --> 01:20:14,999
From the direction, there's only
one place he's heading.

823
01:20:15,574 --> 01:20:16,917
No shit.

824
01:22:01,839 --> 01:22:03,085
Oh, my God!

825
01:22:08,743 --> 01:22:10,085
Don't move! Stay there!

826
01:22:12,291 --> 01:22:13,442
Don't move!

827
01:22:13,825 --> 01:22:16,607
Don't touch anything.
You're grounded by the tyres.

828
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:46,625
The car's going to explode!

829
01:22:51,613 --> 01:22:53,436
I can only hold on for so long.
You know what to do.

830
01:22:54,106 --> 01:22:55,161
Don't!

831
01:22:55,544 --> 01:22:57,558
When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll all be over.

832
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,477
It's the only way
we can cheat death again.

833
01:23:00,052 --> 01:23:01,107
Don't!

834
01:23:01,682 --> 01:23:03,410
I am not going to let it
beat us both.

835
01:23:03,985 --> 01:23:05,135
You know what to do!

836
01:23:07,341 --> 01:23:09,068
I'll always be with you.

837
01:23:13,094 --> 01:23:14,150
Don't!

838
01:23:19,425 --> 01:23:20,960
Get away from there!

839
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:47,909
Damn it!
You can't do this to me.

840
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:50,691
Come on, baby. Come on.

841
01:23:55,006 --> 01:23:56,540
Shit, he's not breathing.

842
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,746
Hold on, Alex. Come on.
Stay with me.

843
01:24:34,328 --> 01:24:35,383
Well, we made it.

844
01:24:35,959 --> 01:24:37,589
Paris.
I can't believe it.

845
01:24:38,163 --> 01:24:39,793
I can't believe
we got on a plane again.

846
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:41,232
Know what I'm saying?

847
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:10,771
It's weird being here, huh?

848
01:25:11,347 --> 01:25:12,594
We finally completed a puzzle.

849
01:25:14,991 --> 01:25:16,333
It's just
there's something missing.

850
01:25:16,718 --> 01:25:17,773
You know?

851
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,088
To Terry.

852
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:23,735
And to Tod.

853
01:25:23,815 --> 01:25:24,966
To all of our friends
that can't be here.

854
01:25:25,446 --> 01:25:26,596
Cheers.

855
01:25:30,432 --> 01:25:31,486
What?

856
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:33,884
If you would've told me
six months ago...

857
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,570
the three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

858
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:40,502
I don't know.
Sometimes it feels like...

859
01:25:41,077 --> 01:25:43,284
you two are the only ones
who understand.

860
01:25:47,023 --> 01:25:48,846
You were right, Browning.

861
01:25:49,326 --> 01:25:50,668
It did skip us.
There was a design.

862
01:25:52,298 --> 01:25:54,121
We beat it. We won.

863
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:58,245
The only thing we won
is a chance at a full life.

864
01:25:59,492 --> 01:26:01,410
A chance
that I won't ever waste.

865
01:26:04,095 --> 01:26:06,779
There's just something
I can't figure out.

866
01:26:07,355 --> 01:26:09,561
- About what?
- The design.

867
01:26:10,137 --> 01:26:12,055
Just let it go, all right?

868
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,932
Hear me out, all right?

869
01:26:16,563 --> 01:26:18,482
- Oh, my God.
- Just listen.

870
01:26:19,057 --> 01:26:22,029
The explosion path determined
the order of our deaths.

871
01:26:22,604 --> 01:26:25,194
When I intervened
and saved Carter...

872
01:26:25,673 --> 01:26:28,743
it skipped him and went
to the next person... Billy.

873
01:26:29,318 --> 01:26:30,182
Then it was Clear.

874
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:32,099
But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me.

875
01:26:32,674 --> 01:26:36,032
But in my case,
no one intervened, right?

876
01:26:37,183 --> 01:26:38,332
I was thrown
from that power line...

877
01:26:38,813 --> 01:26:40,059
by the explosion, so...

878
01:26:40,634 --> 01:26:42,265
So why did it skip you?

879
01:26:42,648 --> 01:26:44,855
How do we know this isn't
what was meant to happen?

880
01:26:45,526 --> 01:26:47,252
That out of everyone
on flight 180...

881
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:49,842
you, me, and Carter
were meant to live?

882
01:26:50,993 --> 01:26:52,815
Maybe that was
the design all along.

883
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:56,555
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

884
01:26:57,801 --> 01:26:59,048
I didn't make up the rules.

885
01:26:59,529 --> 01:27:01,351
Somebody's got to intervene
before death can skip them.

886
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:04,419
Alex proved that three times
with the plane, me, and you.

887
01:27:05,092 --> 01:27:06,530
For all I know,
it could circle back...

888
01:27:07,009 --> 01:27:08,064
and get us all again.

889
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,941
But I am the safest fucker
in the world...

890
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,626
because you're still next.

891
01:27:18,517 --> 01:27:20,245
Can we just stop talking
about this?

892
01:27:20,723 --> 01:27:22,067
Let's figure out...

893
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:39,042
I'll meet you back
at the hotel.

894
01:27:39,617 --> 01:27:40,384
I'll go with you.

895
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:44,124
No, just stay here,
OK, Clear?

896
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:45,771
All right?

897
01:27:45,851 --> 01:27:47,960
See? It's true.
I told you you were next, man.

898
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:50,645
- Stop it, Carter.
- Alex, wait.

899
01:27:51,126 --> 01:27:53,043
Clear, stay there.
OK?

900
01:27:53,618 --> 01:27:54,674
Stay away.

901
01:28:02,175 --> 01:28:03,775
Alex!

902
01:28:25,651 --> 01:28:28,625
- I told you you were next!
- It skipped me.

903
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,542
So who's next?
